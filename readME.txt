I'm building a portfolio website to demonstrate my web development skills. I have some project webpages that I want to demonstrate on the portfolio page. What are some options to demonstrate these projects. I was thinking each project should have a visual representation that is either a video that plays when being hovered over or a window within the webpage that can be interacted

projects:
Library
Blog
Etch A Sketch
Final Challenge
Sign Up Form Exercise
Odins Foundations
flexbox challenge 4

**Nav challenge and flexbox 3 not needed
