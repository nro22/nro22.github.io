I'm building a portfolio website to demonstrate my web development skills. I have some project webpages that I want to demonstrate on the portfolio page. What are some options to demonstrate these projects. I was thinking each project should have a visual representation that is either a video that plays when being hovered over or a window within the webpage that can be interacted
